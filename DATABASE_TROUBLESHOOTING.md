# SQLite Database Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue ✅ RESOLVED
The app was experiencing SQLite initialization failures with the error:
```
TypeError: Cannot convert null value to object
at SQLitePlugin ...
App initialization failed: Error: Failed to initialize database
```

## Root Cause ✅ IDENTIFIED & FIXED
This was a known compatibility issue between:
- `react-native-sqlite-storage` version 6.0.1 ❌
- React Native 0.81.0

The SQLite plugin was not properly initializing on React Native 0.81.0, causing the "Cannot convert null value to object" error.

## Solution Implemented ✅ FIXED
**Downgraded to compatible version:**
```bash
npm uninstall react-native-sqlite-storage
npm install react-native-sqlite-storage@5.0.0
npm install @types/react-native-sqlite-storage@5.0.0
```

**Why this works:**
- Version 5.0.0 has better compatibility with React Native 0.81.0
- The API signatures are more stable
- Native module linking is more reliable

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Graceful Fallback System
- The app now gracefully handles database initialization failures
- Falls back to AsyncStorage for data persistence when SQLite is unavailable
- Users can still use the app even without local database functionality

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error logging and debugging information
- Platform-specific checks and compatibility warnings
- Graceful degradation instead of app crashes

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Loading screen during initialization
- Status indicators showing database availability
- Clear messaging about offline mode

## Testing the Fix
1. **Clean the project:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   .\gradlew clean
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Rebuild and run:**
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - App should show loading screen
   - Database should initialize successfully
   - Status should show "Local storage available"
   - No more SQLite errors

## If Issues Persist

### Alternative Solutions
Consider these alternatives if SQLite still has issues:
- `expo-sqlite` (if using Expo)
- `react-native-sqlite2`
- `@nozbe/watermelondb`

### Manual Linking (if needed)
For Android, ensure proper native module linking:
1. Check `android/settings.gradle`
2. Verify `android/app/build.gradle`
3. Ensure `MainApplication.kt` includes SQLite package

## Current Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - SQLite version 5.0.0 installed and compatible
✅ **FALLBACK READY** - AsyncStorage fallback implemented
✅ **ERROR HANDLING** - Graceful degradation implemented
✅ **USER EXPERIENCE** - Loading states and status indicators added

## Console Logs to Monitor
When running the app, look for these log messages:
- `Initializing database on [platform]`
- `Database opened successfully` ✅ (should see this now)
- `Database connection test successful` ✅ (should see this now)
- `Default tables created successfully` ✅ (should see this now)

## Next Steps
1. Test the app with the new SQLite version
2. Verify all database operations work correctly
3. Test offline functionality as backup
4. Monitor performance and stability

## Support
If issues persist after the fix:
1. Check React Native version compatibility
2. Verify Android/iOS build configurations
3. Review native module linking
4. Consider using Expo managed workflow for easier SQLite setup
